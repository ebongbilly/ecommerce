# Ecommerce

**Ecommerce** is a basic and fun ecommerce solution for everyone, built entirely with **Node.js** and a database.  
This lightweight project does not rely on any frameworks â€“ just the essentials to provide a smooth ecommerce experience.  

In addition to core ecommerce features, the solution includes a **Content Management System (CMS)** to enable users to write blog posts and manage product items seamlessly.

## Features

### Ecommerce
- **Product Listing**: Display items with details such as name, price, and description.
- **Cart Management**: Add, view, update, and remove items from the shopping cart.
- **Checkout Flow**: Mimics placing an order and saving order details to the database.

### CMS
- **Product Management**: Add, update, and delete products via a secure admin panel.
- **Blog Management**: Write, edit, and publish blog posts directly from the CMS.
- **Authentication**: User roles for admin and customers (future enhancements planned).

## Technologies Used

This project is powered by:
- **Node.js**: Backend server handling routing, logic, and APIs.
